## Current Ideas:
1. Using mapbox and GeoNames API somehow
2. Using MIT Datasets, combining it with mapbox
3. Using Mapbox and a weather api to display the temperature of varying locations, particularly the Glacier places
4. Mapbox and New York Times to see where events in news are occuring
5. Combine data about water, heat, natural risks with mapbox to show risk of living there in the future (Mapbox, US Climate Resilience Tookkit, UI Path)
